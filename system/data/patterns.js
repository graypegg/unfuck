/**
 * Use this file for amending the AST for complex
 * patterns that can be detected via a regaulr exp.
 * 
 * Regular expressions will be matched against the
 * remaining Brainfuck that has not been converted to
 * into the AST. Thus you should start all patterns
 * with:
 * 
 * 		pattern: /^ ...
 * 		
 * 	to match the begining of the line and not detect
 * 	the same pattern appearing further into the
 * 	program.
 * 	
 * 	The action function is passed the matched string
 * 	from the Brainfuck program and an empty AST to
 * 	push to. You can add as many AST actions as you
 * 	need to emulate the side effects of Brainfuck.
 * 
 * - Remember! ---------------------------------------
 * > AST must produce the same side effects brainfuck
 *   produces!
